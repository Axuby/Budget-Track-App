This was a 6+ week long project built after my internship  at Genesys Tech Hub. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-4.0` and `redux`.

This was a 3 week long project built after my internship  at Genesys Tech Hub. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to track their budgets and expenses but currently I want to integrate a firebase-backend for authentication and storage. I started this process by using  `webpack` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-4.0` and `redux` for state management.

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into OAuth, Auth0, and two-factor authentication using Firebase or other third parties. Due to project time constraints, I had to table authentication and focus more on data visualization from parts of the API that weren't restricted to authenticated users.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, JSX, and SCSS. I chose to use the `webpack.config`  for initial setup and subsequent configuration to more fully understand the build process while investing more time in diving into technological rabbit holes.
